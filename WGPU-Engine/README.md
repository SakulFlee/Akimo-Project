# WGPU-Engine

A Engine & Framework, possibly game at some point, written in [WGPU] to learn more about it and comparing it to [Vulkan] :)

This repository always was a research project and never more.
It should probably not be used by anyone for anything, but I did license it and archived it in case anyone enjoys working with this.  
In case anyone actually touches this, you may wanna check out the [Problems](./Problems.md) document where I talk about current issues that would need to be fixed eventually.
